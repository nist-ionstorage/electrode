Description
===========

Electrode is a toolkit to develop and analyze RF ion traps. It can
optimize 2D surface electrode patterns to achieve desired trapping
properties and extract relevant parameters of the resulting geometry.
The software also treats precomputed 3D volumetric field and potential
data transparently.

Dependencies
============

Debian based GNU/Linuxes
------------------------

    # apt-get install python-cvxopt python-numpy python-matplotlib \
                      python-scipy python-traits

to use the ipython based notebooks, try

    # apt-get install ipython-notebook


Usage
=====

Running console scripts
-----------------------

Without installing anything
...........................

Use e.g.:

    $ PYTHONPATH=. python notebooks/rfjunction.py

to run a script without instaling the electrode package.


Keeping the package files editable
..................................

    # python setup.py develop

installs the package into your python tree such that it can be imported
from any script anywhere on your system. It only creates links from
your python tree to this development tree and changes in the package
immediately become visible.


Full installation
.................

    # python setup.py install

installs the package in your python tree by copying and compiling the
files. After this, changes to the package files in this development tree
become only visible if you install the package again.


Runing the notebooks
....................

Ensure you have ipython > 0.11 with ipython notebook installed, then run

    $ ipython notebook --pylab=inline --notebook-dir=notebooks --script

and open "threefold" or "rfjunction" in the browser window that appears.
